# Global-Debt
Just like citizens go to a bank if they need money to grow economically, countries also approach the World Bank for loans to support development in their countries. In this project, you will explore countries' debts to the World Bank using SQL.

Dataset: The dataset belongs to the World Bank and contains information about how much money countries worldwide owing to the Bank

Using SQL commands on the dataset, answer the following questions:

What is the total amount of money that countries owe to the World Bank?
Which country has the highest debt, and how much is that?
What is the mean debt owed by countries for different debt indicators?
